## Description
This is the simple intuitive stopwatch application using HTML,CSS and JavaScript

## Features
   - **Start:** Begin timing from zero or resume timing after a pause.
   - **Pause:** Temporarily halt the stopwatch without resetting the elapsed time.
   - **Reset:** Set the stopwatch back to zero clearing all elapsed and paused times.
   - **Display Paused Times:** View a list of all times when the stopwatch was paused.     
## Skills Used
  - **HTML5:** Structuring of webpage and its content(simply structure of stopwatch).
  - **CSS3:** Styled the applications for an appealing user interface.
  - **JavaScript:** Implementing the functionality of the stopwatch,including starting,pausing,resetting and recording paused times.
## Code Structure
  - **index.html:** Contains the HTML structure for the stopwatch.
  - **style1.css:** Contains the CSS styles for the application.
  - **script1.js:** Contains the JavaScript logic for the stopwatch functionality.
## Experience
